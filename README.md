Overview
---
This repository includes the Eagle design files (schematics and layout) for our
[Motor Shield for the Arduino Uno][1]. The shield design is based on two ICs:
the Toshiba TB6612FNG dual motor driver and the NXP PCA9685 16-bit PWM
generator.  The TB6612FNG uses the PWM signals generated by the PCA9685 to set
the speed and direction of the motor(s) connected to its output.  The PWM
signals are set by the commands sent from the Arduino to the PCA9685
via I2C.

The shield includes 2 motor driver chips, so it's able to control up to 4
bi-directional DC motors, 2 stepper motors (uni- or bi-polar), or a combination
of the two types.  

The PWM chip is controlled via I2C, which allows the shield to be stackable.
By setting each shield on the stack to a different I2C address we can control
(in theory) up to 32 of these shields with a single Arduino.

A couple of standard 3-pin headers are readily available on the board for
connecting servo motors directly to pins D8 and D9 on the Arduino.

The firmware files along with code samples are also included in this
repository.

This product was heavily inspired by the [Adafruit Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield
for Arduino][2], and it's released under a (hopefully) compatible open-source
license detailed below.
